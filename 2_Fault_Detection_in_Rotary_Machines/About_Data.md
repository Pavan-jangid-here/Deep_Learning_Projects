About Dataset
MATLAB Simulation Dataset for Electrical Engineering ML Analysis


https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamrajgupta/fault-detection-in-rotatory-machines/code


This dataset was generated from MATLAB simulations conducted for an Electrical Engineering project. The data was later processed and analyzed using machine learning models in Python (Colab).

🔬 Overview
The dataset represents time-series signal responses (voltage, current, and load) simulated under varying noise and operating conditions. It can be used for supervised learning tasks such as regression and classification.
